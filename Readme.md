# ðŸš² **Bike Rental Analysis Dashboard & Consumer Behavior Insights**  

## ðŸ“‹ **Project Description**  
This project has two main components:  

1. **Dashboard Application**  
   An interactive interface built with [Streamlit]([https://streamlit.io/](https://bike-rental-analysis-2011-2012-mes7c2vd6lqmpuzm5p8uh5.streamlit.app/)) to explore bike rental consumer behavior during 2011 and 2012.  

2. **Data Analysis with Jupyter Notebook**  
   A detailed analysis of bike rental data using Python, uncovering patterns based on seasons, weather, and time of day.

## ðŸš€ **Key Features**  

### **Dashboard Application**  
- **Interactive Visualizations:**  
  Displays trends in bike rentals by time, season, and weather conditions.  
- **Dynamic Filtering:**  
  Filter data by date range, weather conditions, and other categories.  
- **Key Statistics:**  
  Summarized metrics such as average rentals per month or day.  

### **Data Analysis**  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  Includes data cleaning and exploration to uncover key trends.  
- **Visualizations:**  
  Insights into bike rental behavior visualized through:  
  - *Number of Bike Rentals:* Comparison of rentals on holidays vs. weekdays.  
  - *Weather and Season Behavior:* Impact of weather conditions and seasons.  
  - *Correlation Between Rentals and Seasons:* Time series analysis of daily rentals.  
  - *Environmental Factors:*  
    - Humidity: Categorized into low, medium, and high.  
    - Temperature: Analyzed in low, medium, and high ranges.  
    - Wind Speed: Grouped into low, medium, and high levels.  
  Visualization techniques include bar charts for categorical data and time series plots for trends.  
- **Clustering Data:**  
  Environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, and wind speed) were clustered into three levels:  
  - Low: Lower range of conditions.  
  - Medium: Mid-range of conditions.  
  - High: Higher range of conditions.  
  This intuitive categorization aids further analysis and decision-making.

## ðŸ“Š **Dataset**  
The dataset is sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Bike Sharing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).  

### **Details:**  
- **Time Period:** 2011-2012  
- **Key Features:**  
  - `count`: Number of bike rentals  
  - `temp`: Temperature  
  - `season`: Season  
  - `weather`: Weather condition
